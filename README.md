# Diabetes-Prediction-using-ML-techniques
 The main aim of this project is to predict whether the person is diabetic positive or not with the help of some statistical tool. So, we have used three  methods for classification in this project are Logistic regression, K Nearest neighbor and Bernoulli Na√Øve Bayes classifiers.

The study is based on the secondary dataset available on the Kaggle. The data has been collected using direct questionnaires from the patients of Sylhet Diabetes 
Hospital in Sylhet, Bangladesh and approved by a doctor. The responses of the survey are dichotomous in nature. The dataset includes 520 observations with 17 variables to study. 

The variables are as follows Age, gender, Polyuria-excessive urination, Polydipsia-excess thirst, Sudden weight loss, weakness, Polyphagia-excessive eating, Genital thrush, Visual blurring, Itching, Irritability, Delayed healing, Partial paresis-weakening of muscles, Muscle stiffness, Alopecia-Baldness/hair loss, Obesity, Class .
Here, the target variable is class, the outcome of target variable will be binary (positive or negative) where, positive means individual is having diabetes and negative means individual does not have diabetes. All the observations are independent of each other.
